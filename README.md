# Experimental SBEC3 reflashing kernel
---------  

## Commands
---------

### Erase:
---------
  * Request: ````20 0X XX XX````
     * 0X XX XX can be any 20 bit address inside the target bank, e.g. Bank 0 is ````04 00 00````
  * Response: ````21 0X XX XX````
     * After the response, we enter a timer-loop that counts down approximately 15 seconds, attempting the block-erase command each iteration until time runs out or it succeeds.  SCI RX must be +20V for the delete to succeed.
    * Success: ````22````
    * Failure: The content of the flash chip's Command State Register containing error bit values

#### Bank base addresses for M28F200 and compatible flash chips:
---------
   * Bank 0: ````0x40000```` (16K)
   * Bank 1: ````0x44000```` (8k)
   * Bank 2: ````0x46000```` (8K)
   * Bank 3: ````0x48000```` (96K)
   * Bank 4: ````0x60000```` (128K)

### Write:
---------

#### Write to buffer:
  * Request: ````30 0Y YY````
         * YY is the count of bytes to write to RAM buffer, zero indexed, ````0x0000```` to ````0xFFFF````. Writes from Command 30 populate a RAM buffer starting at ````0x00540````.
    * Response: ````31 0Y YY````
       * Follow the response with ````0x0YYY```` bytes of data to be written to RAM buffer
       * Bytes not echoed
       * SCI RX does NOT have to be +20V
   * Success: ````22```` is echoed when YYYY bytes have been received.
   * **Note**: The RAM buffer size is limited to the amount of available RAM. I don't recommend greater than ````0x03FF```` (1K) unless you know what you're doing.  There is no range check and we will happily try to write off the end of RAM and crash if you ask us to.

#### Write to flash:
   * Request: ````40 0X XX XX 0Y YY````
       * 0X XX XX is the starting address in flash memory for the write
       * YYYY is the count of bytes to write from the RAM buffer to flash anbd should match the YYYY used to stage data to RAM.
   * Response: ````41 0X XX XX YY YY````
      * After sending the response, we enter a timer-loop that counts down approximately 15 seconds, attempting a write each iteration until time runs out or it succeeds. SCI RX must be +20V for the write to succeed.
   * Success: ````22```` is echoed when YY bytes have been successfully written to flash memory
   * Failure:
      * Write error: ````0x01````
      * Timeout: ````0x80````
* **Note**:The expectation is a pattern of ````30 0Y YY <bytes>```` to stage data to RAM, followed by a ````40 0X XX XX 0Y YY```` and a switch to +20V on SCI RX (switched off on 22/success) to write staged data to flash, followed by another 30, then 40, etc, etc.

### Bulk Read:
---------
   * Request: ````45 0X XX XX YY YY````
       * 0X XX XX is a 20 bit address start address for the read
       * YY YY is a 16 bit count of bytes to return
   * Response: ````46 0X XX XX YY YY````
       * Response will be followed by ````YY YY```` count of bytes starting from ````0X XX XX````
   * Success: ````22````
   * **Note**: Too large of a ````YY YY```` value can cause unexpected problems on your recieving device.  Be cautious with large values

### EEPROM read:
---------
   * Request: ````50 0X XX````
      * 0X XX represents an EEPROM offset.  For example, the ECU part number is offset 0x01F0 to 0x01F3
   * Response: ````51 0X XX YY YY````
      * This command works in full word widths (16 bits) and thus always returns two bytes.
   * Failure:
      * ````51 0X XX 01```` if the EEPROM read fails.

### EEPROM write:
---------
   * Request: ````55 0X XX YY YY````
      * 0X XX represents an EEPROM offset.  
      * YY YY is the 16 bit word to write starting at offset 0X XX
   * Response: ````56 0X XX YY YY YY YY````
      * The complete command is echoed with a 56 acknowledge, with the addition of the contents of the EEPROM offset after writing.
      * No error checking is done with these values in the reflash kernel. If they don't match, the write did not succeed. 
   * Failure:
      * ````51 0X XX YY YY 01```` if the EEPROM write fails. (probably?)
